# horiseon_webpage_code_refactor

For this project, I was tasked with refactoring the source code for Horiseon's website. Through the use of semantic elements and consolidation of CSS rules, I was able to increase the website's accesibilty to users and fellow programmers while decreasing the amount of code overall.

An overview of of the updates:
    <ul>
    <li>*changed the title element to something more descriptive</li>
    *fixed a broken nav link
    *elimnated needless <div> elements and replaced them with semantic tags
    *added alt attributes to all images and icons
    *consolidated repeating CSS rules
    *orangized CSS rules by positioning global attributes at the top of the stylesheet, followed by rules pertaining to semantic elements by order in which they appear on the page
    *added descriptive comments to HTML and CSS files to help with code navigation 
    </ul>
