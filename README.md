# horiseon_webpage_code_refactor

For this project, I was tasked with refactoring the source code for Horiseon's website. Through the use of semantic elements and consolidation of CSS rules, I was able to increase the website's accesibilty to users and fellow programmers while decreasing the amount of code overall.

<h2>An overview of of the updates:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>*changed the title element to something more descriptive</li>
    <li>*fixed a broken nav link</li>
    <li>*elimnated needless <div> elements and replaced them with semantic tags</li>
    <li>*added alt attributes to all images and icons</li>
    <li>*consolidated repeating CSS rules</li>
    <li>*orangized CSS rules by positioning global attributes at the top of the stylesheet, followed by rules pertaining to semantic elements by order in which they appear on the page</li>
    <li>*added descriptive comments to HTML and CSS files to help with code navigation</li>
    </ul>
